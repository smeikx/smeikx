Hi, let us abandon this weird place. Come join me at [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/smeikx)! ðŸ’š

Are you still hosting _free, **open source** software_ on a _proprietary, **closed source**_ platform?  
A platform, run by a company that has been standing in the way of FOSS for decades and, on top of that, does not care too much about ethics either.

For more reasons for giving up GitHub have a look at [fconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/).


## Alternatives

Itâ€™s time to go, so better check out some alternatives real quick.

There are some nice projects powered by [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/), [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) is one of the better known sites, [but there are more](https://codeberg.org/forgejo-contrib/delightful-forgejo#public-instances).

Or maybe try [sourcehut](https://sourcehut.org/), itâ€™s in relative early development but works well and is super fast!

You can also host these two yourself! You could also host a more minimalistic approach like Soft Serve: just run `ssh git.charm.sh -t soft-serve` to have a look.

Of course, these are just a few examples, but you will most likely find more if you want to.
